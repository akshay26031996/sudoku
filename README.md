### Sudoku

#### Generating Algorithm
1. A random sudoku grid is filled.
2. Start removing random numbers and check if there is only one possible solution. If there are more than one solution, decrease the remaining attempts.
3. Remove numbers untill number of attempts remaining are zero. To increase the difficulty, increase the number of attempts.
